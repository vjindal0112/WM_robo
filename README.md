Code for Robot Arm event in Science Olympiad

Using 5 Servos, 3 Stepper Motors, 1 CR Servo, 1 arduino with a motor controller board, and 1 Custom PCB (credits to David Cutting), we built a robot from scratch that unfolds and picks up pennies for the 2017 Science Olympiad Event for Robot Arm and achieved a perfect score.

I wrote all of the code in Arduino C/C++.

The robot completed the entire task autonomously by running v4_penny_deposit and v4_Scary_arm_simple simultaneously on two parallel systems.

Partners: Nestor Tkachenko and David Cutting
